<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></h2>


<p>Through all the work of Arthur Davison Ficke
runs a note of bigness that compels attention
even when one feels that he is still groping both for
form and thought. In "Mr. Faust" this note has
assumed commanding proportions, while at the same
time the uncertainty manifest in some of the earlier
work has almost wholly disappeared. Intellectually as
well as artistically, this play shows a surprising maturity.
It impresses me, for one, as the expression of
a well-rounded and very profound philosophy of life&mdash;and
this philosophy stands in logical and sympathetic
relationship to what the western world to-day
regards as its most advanced thought. The evolutionary
conception of life is the foundation of that philosophy,
which, however, has little or nothing in common with
the materialistic and dogmatic evolutionism of the last
century. The work sprung from that philosophy is
full of the new sense of mystery, which makes the men
of to-day realize that the one attitude leading nowhere
is that of denial. Faith and doubt walk hand in hand,
each one being to the other check and goad alike. And
with this new freedom to believe as well as to question,
man becomes once more the centre of his known universe.
But there he stands, humbly proud, not as the
arrogant master of a "dead" world, but merely as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the foremost servant of a life-principle which asserts
itself in the grain of sand as in the brain of man.</p>

<p>Yet "Mr. Faust" is by no means a philosophical or
moral tract. It is, first of all and throughout, a living,
breathing work of art, instinct with beauty and faithful
in its every line to the principle laid down by its
author in the preface to one of his earlier volumes:
"Poetical imagination must fail altogether if it descends
from its natural sphere and assumes work which
is properly that of economic or political experience.
Nor can it usefully urge its own peculiar intuitions as
things of practical validity."</p>

<p>Mr. Ficke was born in 1883 at Davenport, Iowa,
and there he is still living, although I understand
that he has since then been wandering in so many
other regions, physical and spiritual, that he can
hardly call it his home. He graduated from Harvard
in 1904 and spent the next travelling in all
sorts of strange and poetic places&mdash;Japan, India,
the Greek mountains, the Aegean Islands. Returning
to the United States, he studied law and was admitted
to the Bar in 1908. While studying, he taught English
for a year at the University of Iowa, lecturing on the
history of the Arthurian Legends.</p>

<p>He was a mere boy when he began to write, turning
from the first to the metrical form of expression and
remaining faithful to it in most of his subsequent efforts.
His poems and essays have been printed in
almost all the leading magazines. So far he has published
five volumes of verse: "From the Isles," a
series of lyrics of the Aegean Sea; "The Happy Princess,"
a romantic narrative poem; "The Earth Passion,"
a series of poems which may be characterized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
as the effort of a star-gazer to find satisfaction in
the things of the earth; "The Breaking of Bonds,"
a Shelleyan drama of social unrest, where he has tried
to formulate a hope for our final emergence from the
maelstrom of class-conflict; and "Twelve Japanese
Painters," a group of poems expressive of the peculiar
and alluring charm of the great Japanese painters and
their world of remote beauty.</p>

<h2>THE FIRST ACT<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></h2>

<p><i>The scene is the library of John Faust, a large handsome
room panelled in dark oak and lined with rows
of books in open book-shelves. On the right is a carved
white stone fireplace, with deep chairs before it. In
the far left corner of the room, on a pedestal, stands
a stiff bust of George Washington. Near it hangs a
wonderful Titian portrait, a thing of another world.
The furniture looks as if it were, and probably is, plunder
from the palace of some prince of the Renaissance.</i></p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 1em"><i>A fire is burning in the fireplace; it, and several
shaded lights, make a subdued brilliancy in the room.
Before the fire sits John Faust. Brander and Oldham,
both in evening dress, lounge comfortably in chairs
near Faust. All three are smoking, and tall highball
glasses stand within their reach.</i></p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines">You are a thorn to me, a thorn in the flesh.<br />
Contagiously you bring to me mistrust<br />
Of all my landmarks, when, as here to-night,<br />
Out of the midst of every pleasant gift<br />
The world can offer you, you raise your voice<br />
In scoffing irony against each face,<br />
Form, action, motive, that together make<br />
Your life, and ours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">Dear man, I did not mean</span><br />
To send my poor jokes burrowing like a mole<br />
Beneath your prized foundations.</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 12em">Not alone</span><br />
Your attitude to-night; you always seem<br />
As if withholding from all days and deeds<br />
Moving around you&mdash;from our life and yours&mdash;<br />
Your full assent.</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 7em">Dear Brander! Is it true</span><br />
I am as bad as that? Well, though I were,<br />
Why should it trouble you? If you find sport<br />
In this strange game, this fevered interplay,<br />
This hodge-podge crazy-quilt which we are pleased<br />
To call our life&mdash;why, like it! And say: Damned<br />
Be all who are not with me!</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 10em">Are not you?</span></p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines">I claim the criminal's privilege, and decline<br />
To answer.</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 6em">Faust, might I presume so far</span><br />
As to suggest that I should like a drink<br />
Before you two start breaking furniture<br />
Over this matter?</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">Certainly; I beg</span><br />
Your pardon; I neglected you.<br />
(<i>He busies himself with the glasses</i>)<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><span style="padding-left: 13em">No, no,</span><br />
We won't wage combat over this. You're right,<br />
Doubtless, as usual, Brander. I have not<br />
Your fortunate placidity of mind,<br />
And I get grumpy.</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">Come, fill up your glass;</span><br />
And let us drink to the glories of the world.<br />
Down with the cynic!</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 9em">Down with him, indeed!</span><br />
And may he cease to trouble you. The world<br />
Is pretty glorious when a man is young,<br />
As we are, and so many splendid choices<br />
Lie all around him. There have never been<br />
Such opportunities as now are spread<br />
Before us. Men are doing mighty things<br />
To-day. A critic tells me that last night<br />
Wullf at the opera sang "<i>La ci darem</i>"<br />
With an artistic brilliancy of tone<br />
That never has been heard on any stage<br />
Anywhere in the world. You moped at home,<br />
Doubtless; but it was wonderful, on my word.</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines">Whom did you go with?</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 10em">Midge.</span></p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 12em">Ah, Midge again!</span><br />
I thought so....</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 6em">Well, I don't know why I shouldn't.</span></p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines">Those rosy-toned remarks gave you away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><br />
Perhaps 'twas not "Don Juan" that last night<br />
Was at its best, but Midge. Where did you sit?</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines">Up in the gallery.</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">The top one?</span></p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 14em">Yes.</span></p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines">Once more, I thought so. You and Midge would look<br />
Nice in a box! Yes, I will pay for one<br />
If you will take it.</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">Oh, leave me alone!</span></p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines">Who is this "Midge" you speak of?</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 12em">Midge, dear Faust,</span><br />
Is short for Margaret; which, you may guess,<br />
Describes a lady of the female sex;<br />
Said person being serviceably employed<br />
As maid-of-all-work for some ancient dame<br />
In Brander's own apartment house. She has,<br />
Beside what other virtues I know not,<br />
A most bewitching ankle and a taste<br />
For opera. And dear Brander's kindly heart<br />
Is so moved by the sight of these combined,<br />
He sometimes sneaks, by lonely alley-ways,<br />
With his fair Midge, and in the gallery<br />
High out of sight of all of us enjoys<br />
Her and the opera.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 9em">I did not know</span><br />
You had a lady-love.</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">It's hardly that!</span><br />
But she's a mighty jolly little thing.</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines">What sort of girl is she?</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 10em">A mighty nice one!</span><br />
Full of all kinds of happiness; but shy.<br />
I'd like to see some rounder try to speak<br />
To her on Broadway. She looks like a lady!</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines">That is too bad.</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 6em">Oh, pshaw! Don't lecture me;</span><br />
I'm not a saint; in fact, few of us are.</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines">Unfortunately not. I least of all.<br />
And yet I wonder if.... However, I<br />
Do not presume to lecture you. Remember<br />
One thing, though, as my friend. Your Midge has deeps<br />
Not pleasant under her if you let go.</p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines">Oh, I will not let go!... Not yet, at least.</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines">Faust really means it, strange as it may seem.<br />
Of late he has turned moralist.</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 12em">Not quite:</span><br />
But just a little tired of pursuits<br />
That end regretfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 12em;">Well, don't pursue....</span></p>

<p class="speaker">BRANDER</p>

<p class="lines">(<i>Goes to the window and raises the shade</i>)<br />
See, what a night it is! The stars are out<br />
As if a bucketful of them had spilled<br />
Across the sky. And here we sit like owls,<br />
Blinking and staring at a little fire<br />
When heaven is burning! I'm afraid it's time<br />
For me to leave this owlish parliament;<br />
And I shall probably knock holes in half<br />
The windows of the town as I walk home<br />
Star-gazingly. And here it's after twelve!<br />
I might have guessed it from the fatal fact<br />
That we'd begun to talk philosophy:<br />
No sane man ever does, except in hours<br />
When by all rights he should be sound asleep.<br />
Good night to both of you. And don't stay up<br />
Talking till morning.</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">Well, good night.</span></p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 14em">Good night,</span><br />
Brander, I'm sorry you must go: come in<br />
Quite soon again, and I will try to be<br />
Less disagreeable than I was to-night.<br />

Sometimes.</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 14em">Of course,</span><br />
And so do I; but I would not exchange<br />
Heads for a kingdom.</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">Are you so fond, then,</span><br />
Of what's in yours?</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">No, but at least I have</span><br />
A certain faint perception of the gilded<br />
And quite preposterous crudeness of our days&mdash;<br />
The sordid sickness of his life, and ours;<br />
And that is something to be thankful for.</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

A poisoned irony so bitter springs<br />
To-night?</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 6em">I am revolving in my brain</span><br />
This serious question: whether 'tis not best<br />
That one turn humorist. The mind that seeks<br />
Holiness, finds it seldom; who pursues<br />
Beauty perhaps shall in a lengthened life<br />
Find it perfected only once or twice.<br />
But if one's quest were humor&mdash;what rich stores,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br />
What tropic jungles of it, lie to hand<br />
At every moment, everywhere one turns&mdash;<br />
What luscious meadows for the humorist!</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines">No&mdash;for the satirist! There is no humor<br />
In what you see and I see when we look<br />
On this crude world wherein our lives are spent&mdash;<br />
This sordid sphere where we are but spectators&mdash;<br />
This crass grim modern spectacle of lives<br />
Torn with consuming lust of one desire&mdash;<br />
Gold, gold, forever gold&mdash; Or do you find<br />
Humor in that?</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 6em">It might be found, perhaps:</span><br />
The joke's on someone!</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 9em">There's no joke in it!</span><br />
It is the waste, the pitiful waste of life!<br />
Men&mdash;slaves to gather gold&mdash;become then slaves<br />
Beneath its gathered weight. For this one hope,<br />
All finer longings perish at their birth.<br />
Men's eyes to-day envy no sage or seer<br />
Or conqueror except his triumphs be<br />
In this base sphere of commerce. The stars go out<br />
In factory smoke; the spirit wanes and pales<br />
In poisoned air of greed. It is an age<br />
Of traders and of tricksters; all the high<br />
And hounded malefactors of great wealth<br />
Differ from the masses, in their wealth, indeed;<br />
But in their malefaction, not at all.<br />
Your grocer and my butcher have at heart<br />
The selfsame aims as he to whom we pay<br />
Tribute for every pound of coal we burn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><br />
Their scope is narrower, but their act the same<br />
As his&mdash;against whose millions all the tongues<br />
Of little tricksters in each corner store<br />
Babble and rail and shriek!</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 11em">Almost you do</span><br />
Persuade me to turn humorist on the spot!<br />
Was ever, since Gargantua, such a vine<br />
Heavy with bursting clusters of the grape<br />
Of humor?</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 4em">Of corruption! You may laugh;</span><br />
But there's in all your laughter hardly more<br />
Mirth than in my upbraidings. Ah, I grow<br />
So weary of this low-horizoned scene,<br />
Our generation; I am always drawn<br />
In thought toward that great noon of human life<br />
When in the streets of Florence walked the powers<br />
And princes of the earth&mdash;Politian, Pico,<br />
Angelo, Leonardo, Botticelli&mdash;<br />
And a half-hundred more of starry-eyed<br />
Sons of the morning, in whose hearts the god<br />
Struggled unceasing. Ah, those lucent brains,<br />
Those bright imaginations, those keen souls,<br />
Arrowy toward each target where truth's gold<br />
Glimmered, or beauty's! Those were days indeed;<br />
We shall not look upon their like again.</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines">I am not sure.</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 6em">Then take my word for it!</span></p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines">I am not sure; the lamentable fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><br />
To me seems otherwise. For I believe<br />
That this vile age of commerce and corruption<br />
Which you describe in very eloquent terms,<br />
Is still, upon the whole, the best that yet<br />
Has graced our earth. I think not more than you<br />
Am I in love with it; but, looking back,<br />
I fail to see a better, though I peer<br />
Into remote arboreal history.</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines">When I was six, my teachers taught me that.<br />
Why, one would think that you had never heard<br />
Of Greece or Italy!</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 8em">And what were they?</span><br />
Your Renaissance, despite its few bright gleams,<br />
Lies like a swamp of darkness, soaked in blood<br />
And agony: such tortures as we scarce<br />
Dream of to-day writhe through it; and the stench<br />
Of slaughtered cities and corrupted thrones&mdash;<br />
Yes, even the Papal throne&mdash;draw me not back<br />
With longing toward it. Rich that time might be<br />
If one were Michael Angelo; but how<br />
If one were peasant, or meek householder,<br />
When the Free Captains ravaged to and fro,<br />
And peoples were the merest pawns of kings<br />
Enslaved by mistresses? The more I look,<br />
The more evaporates that golden haze<br />
Which cloaks the past; the more I doubt if men<br />
Had ever in their breasts more lofty souls<br />
Than those we know. And I am glad to be<br />
A citizen of this material age.</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

Nineteen Thirteen.</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines">I quarrel not with ages&mdash;but with man;<br />
Whose life such play and folly seems&mdash;for all<br />
Its sweat and agony&mdash;that laughter lies<br />
The sole escape from madness. I peruse<br />
The present and the past, only to find<br />
Mountains of human effort piled aloft<br />
Like the Egyptian Pyramids, and toward<br />
No end save folly....</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 10em">All is foolishness!</span><br />
In Argolis, a woman, somewhat vain,<br />
Preferred a fop to her own rightful lord<br />
And ran away; and then for ten long years<br />
The might of Hellas on the Trojan plain<br />
Grappled in conflict such as had been mete<br />
To guard Olympus, and Scamander ran<br />
Red with heroic blood-drops. And they got<br />
The woman. And it all was foolishness!...<br />
That was your Golden Age. I hope you like it.</p>

<p class="lines">Foolishness!... Once a mariner set forth,<br />
With all the fires of heaven lit in his breast<br />
And godlike courage on his brow, to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><br />
New worlds beyond the unknown wastes of sea.<br />
He sailed; he found; he died in rusty chains:<br />
So that, to-day, the vermin of all climes<br />
May thither flock, and there renew the old<br />
Familiar toil toward utter foolishness....</p>

Why all this straining toward an empty end?</p>

<p class="lines">Ah, you forget what Beauty was to them!<br />

Into a nebula of dust.... Ah, well,<br />

My actual days so bitter that despair<br />
Grips me in horror. And besides, I'm due<br />
To pick my brother up. I have, you see,<br />
The limousine to-night, and that entails<br />
Its obligations. Dear modernity!<br />
Whose Saviour is the limousine!... Good night!</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

<p class="lines">Good night. May all the Furies and the Gorgons<br />
Of Greece and Florence leave you in repose<br />
To dream to-night of white-limbed goddesses<br />
And painters like archangels!</p>

<p class="speaker">OLDHAM</p>

<p class="lines"><span style="padding-left: 12em">I deserve it!</span><br />
And yet I fear they will not be so kind....<br />
Sleep is no friend to me these many nights.<br />
I do not know what wrong I can have done<br />
That so offends her she will none of me.<br />
One of these days, she will carry it too far....<br />

Out of this theatre of tinsel days<br />

The vast abysses. What the gallery-gods<br />
Could give, they well have given; but deities<br />
Inscrutabler than they annul all gifts<br />
With one gift more&mdash;the restless mind that peers<br />
Past fame, friends, learning, fortune, to enquire:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><br />
Whither? Whither? Whither? And no answer comes<br />
To the cold player's lips....</p>

By a fulfilling hour when I might say:<br />
"Lo, this is what I hoped!" The vision flies<br />
As I advance; while always far ahead<br />
Its glow makes dim the color of my days;<br />

The bliss of envying.... But I am sick<br />
With the hour's emptiness; and great desire<br />
Fills me for those high beauties which my dreams<br />
Yearn ever toward. I am weary; I would go<br />
Out to some golden sunset-lighted land<br />
Of silence.</p>

Desirous of the infinite&mdash;from defeat<br />
Arising still to grope again for light<br />
And the high word of vision! And in vain!<br />

Inward&mdash;like one betrayed by his last god....</p>

Virtuous Father-of-your-Country look,<br />

Of life or man or liberty; you built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><br />
Unsceptical of bricks, but such as lay<br />
To hand you took, nor did your purpose shake<br />
At prescient thought of how your edifice<br />
Might be turned pest-house some day. Undismayed<br />
By doubt, you rose, and in heroic mould<br />
Led&mdash;dauntless, patient, incorruptible&mdash;<br />
A riot over taxes. Not a star<br />

one, indescribably and faintly, of the fact that<br />

Men sometimes have done mad and foolish things<br />
With consequences sad to view. Some minds,<br />
Reaching your state, and finding life a bane,<br />
Decide within themselves that naught can be<br />
Worse than the present world, and then set out<br />
To revolutionize, rend, whirl, uproot<br />
The world's foundations. And the mess they make<br />

That tale to college boys, whose lonely dreams<br />
Have shaped Iseult of Ireland, Helen of Troy,<br />
As end of heart's desire&mdash;and, lacking these,<br />
Clasp chorus-Aphrodites. But I know<br />
That from the topmost peak of ecstasy<br />
Falls a straight precipice; half-times the foot<br />
Misses the peak&mdash;but never mortal step<br />
Has missed the gulf beyond it. And I see<br />
Where, in night's gorgeous dome, to-morrow waits<br />
With cold insistence. Me you cannot lure<br />
With this poor opiate. And I beg of you<br />

Of the wise soul that sees the abyss of life&mdash;<br />
Sees the grim measure of the mortal doom&mdash;<br />
And over that dark gulf in reckless mirth<br />
Dances on rainbows, with delightful arms<br />
And bosoms close to his. That is a mood<br />

The ancients here that I am proud to write<br />
Some verses now and then. For we have learned<br />
That poetry, like all the other arts,<br />
Is pure technique: the mere ideas are nothing,<br />
The form is everything. That ennobles us<br />

Yes, irresistibly. But past the hour<br />
Wait graver judges. I decline to be,<br />

On the spoiled beer of life. Nor do I lean<br />

Satiety, and child's-play.</p>

Viewing all things as relative.... And yet<br />
Your special temperament may not prefer<br />
Nectar. Those lines of sternness round your mouth<br />
Convince me you are right; another cure<br />
Better befits you. And a mighty one<br />
I set before you, which has ever served<br />
As lodestar for all high and glorious minds,<br />

In madness of desire. For three days more<br />
Come there each noon again; at end of these,<br />
If you have done my bidding, you shall be<br />
Master of the finances of the world,<br />
Despot of nations, unto whom the kings<br />
And captains of the earth shall kneel to crave<br />
Crumbs from the table. Then let pen and sword<br />
Forget their quarrel for supremacy;<br />
Since you can buy them both, or starve them both,<br />

Instate my visions beautiful and pale,<br />
Nearer the heart's desire. No, you would give<br />
Power to direct the miseries of men,<br />

Such as not Hercules mid Western Isles<br />
Found in the Garden of Hesperides.<br />
It is a paradise of secret peace,<br />
A glorious land of amaranthine bloom;<br />
Where happiness, having fled the world, now dwells<br />
In shining gladness. Guarded, deep, sublime<br />
With lights and shadows, lies it: there have hearts<br />
The weariest and the greatest of mankind<br />
Found perfect refuge and abiding-place<br />
For time and for eternity. To few<br />

Forth on my tables such delicious fare<br />

Through time and through eternity. I say:<br />
Fie for a bond written in scrawly blood!<br />
A bond of choice is better. Could a saint<br />

Like far-off song told me this parable:</p>

Borne from the caverns of the deep,<br />

Thy day turns westward, and is gone....<br />
Come thou with me."</p>

<p class="speaker">SATAN</p>

<p class="lines">What an amazing man you really are!<br />
For your own sake, I tried to offer you<br />
A splendid paradise; I brought you here<br />
At infinite cost and trouble; you have had<br />
An hour of insight and experience<br />
New and instructive to you; your best friend<br />
Has found eternal bliss: and now you turn,<br />
And just because your uttermost crazy whim<br />
Is not quite satisfied with what he grasped<br />
Thankfully, you revert, with sorry taste,<br />
To my old careless generous remarks.<br />
I do not think your friends at home would call it<br />
A sporting attitude.</p>

Your laughter sounds! True, you have beaten me,<br />

Ready to pay it.</p>

The chambers of your heart? Will it suffice<br />
In place of that bright paradise you dreamed<br />
Might be your gain as loser? Ah, my friend,<br />
In copper you have won, but lost in gold!<br />
And victory will not requite for that<br />
Your empty treasury.</p>

A hair's breadth only held you from the gates<br />
That Oldham entered. Almost they sufficed<br />
Your spirit; yes, a moth's wing could have blown<br />
You toward them! 'Twas so nearly I fulfilled<br />
All that I promised. Therefore when I speak,<br />
You will, for justice's sake, concede I am<br />
No absolute bungler, no coarse-palated<br />
Plebeian, as to paradises.</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

In other regions, beneath other skies,<br />
One haven more, the only one of earth<br />
That can be judged in glory to surpass<br />
This paradise you entered not. My faith<br />
Is absolute that it is to your need<br />
Utterly moulded. Like your heart itself,<br />
Its halls are structured, destinate for you<br />
As perfect refuge. And I say to you:<br />
Give me the leave, and I will lead you there<br />
For one supreme and ultimate trial of choice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span><br />
That has no doubtful outcome. And my pledge<br />
Shall still be valid! If this refuge gives<br />
Not all that you desire, you still may claim<br />
My service as your slave. Thus do you risk<br />
No atom, but have gain of one last chance<br />
To win the paradise you hunger for!</p>

<p class="speaker">FAUST</p>

The mind behind it.</p>

The mock of destiny&mdash;the man who lost<br />
All joys of the bright many that the world<br />
Cherishes! Aye, and even lost his friend,<br />
His one deep lasting friend&mdash;and stood thereafter<br />
Fixed like a donkey.... Though I led you on<br />
From paradise to paradise, and none<br />
Sufficed you&mdash;that were surely better sport&mdash;<br />
Testing and trying with sublime contempt&mdash;<br />

For now you shall, you shall have paradise!</p>

Better than does barbaric loveliness.<br />
The dome that poises its clear perfect curves<br />
Rising above the palm-trees, with the look<br />
As of a wing&egrave;d bubble lightly resting<br />
On needless masonry&mdash;that symbolled form<br />
Of heavenly perfection never fills<br />

Lifts them up nearer to His arms. Some take<br />
The sin I offer, fall from grace, go down&mdash;<br />
And lost in fathomless gulfs of wickedness,<br />
Cry out with utter yearning to His love<br />
That it may save them, and repentant turn<br />
Their prodigal faces toward His doors again,<br />
Never to wander more. But some few souls,<br />

And purify and fine it that it be<br />
Worthy God's altar. My belov&egrave;d friend,<br />
Such was your trial; thus have I tempted you<br />
With things averse to God, with forms and faiths<br />
Outcast and separate from Him. You have seen<br />
The whole world's vanities; you have come to know<br />

Whose love is refuge: even the living death<br />
Of cold Nirvana frights you. Thus at last,<br />
Knowing that you are powerless, and the world<br />
Bare of salvation for your feebleness,<br />
You stand on this great threshold; and your eyes<br />

The holy and the pure&mdash;from age to age,<br />
Learned, homesick for His home. Their frustrate hopes,<br />
Their burdens heavier than by mortal strength<br />
Can be sustained, their impotence, bow down<br />
Each spirit: and it cries: "O God, support<br />
My helplessness; unto Thy perfect will<br />
Do I resign my vain and evil hopes,<br />
My burdens; and Thy Will Be Done Forever."<br />
Thus, with arms folded on despairing breast,<br />
With head bowed to the inscrutable decree,<br />
They seek Him: and a sudden glory fills<br />
The humbled bosom; all His stars and thrones<br />
Shine down upon it; all His majesty<br />
Enters that lowly door, lifts up, sustains<br />
The sundered soul; and His beneficence<br />
With more than father-love enfolds the heart<br />
Joined to His own forever. From His light<br />
Reflected radiance pours; to the dark sight<br />
Comes glimpse of the high justice of God's will;<br />
And all roads lead to Heaven, and all hearts lie<br />
Within His love, and all's well with the world.<br />

<p class="lines">Thank God for it! That night I saw my joys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span><br />
Like some rank thicket of bright vanities<br />
Masking a precipice. A sense of sin<br />
And loathing overcame me, and the power<br />
Of utter terror filled me. I beheld<br />
The evil riot of gross earthy things<br />
That had o'ergrown me. Like a burden lay<br />
That sense upon me, and it pressed me down<br />
To a despondence deep beyond all words,<br />
Beyond all thought. And no escape I saw<br />
Except the bullet....</p>

Passed like a nightmare. Till, one Sabbath morn,<br />
As restlessly I paced, some random mood<br />
Led me to enter this cathedral's doors<br />
At hour of service. As I knelt, with lips<br />
Unknown to prayer, the mighty music rolled<br />
Over my heart like an all-purging flood,<br />
And a voice chanted: "He that loveth life<br />
Shall lose it; he that hateth this world's life<br />
Shall keep the life eternal." And a voice<br />
Shortly thereafter sang, in angel tones:<br />
"Come, let our feet return unto the Lord;<br />
For He hath torn, and He will heal us." And<br />
My soul cried: "Yield thy burdens to the Lord,<br />
Upon His love cast thine unworthy self,<br />
And bid His Will Be Done."</p>

Light blinded me; an infinite love and joy<br />

God has been with me.... Now you know my tale.</p>

gay and dancing maskers: Harlequin, Columbine, a

Skeleton, Ballet-girls, Oriental Princesses, Monks,
Courtiers, Turks and Jew Pedlers. The first few attempt
to draw back on seeing the chairs and the four
old men; but they are pushed on by those behind.
Once in, they all circle about in a crazy dance, singing
over and over the same verse.</i></p>

That held no sweetness, turn in trust to where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span><br />
In high a&euml;rial spaces far from earth<br />
God in his heaven to all the weary ones<br />
Offers a refuge. And in such a mood<br />
Was I, too, led toward heaven by one whom now<br />
I know my foe&mdash;Satan. Toward God I turned,<br />
Seeking in Him fulfilment of all hopes<br />
That earth had thwarted. Then, in the hour of prayer<br />
And revelation, from my deepest breast<br />
Flashed lightnings. And I saw the Lord of Hosts<br />
High on a mountain, inaccessible<br />
To yearning men, who, mastered by a dream,<br />
Turn skyward from our dark and struggling earth.<br />
I saw the crafty Satan urging on<br />
The heavenward-yearning myriads, while the world<br />
Lay like a stagnant quagmire, to his sway<br />
Wholly abandoned, and man's mortal house<br />
Burned in fierce conflagration of corruption.<br />
And lo! the lightnings from my heart smote forth<br />
Across the heavens; and God dissolved like cloud,<br />
And through the cloud peered Satan's sinister face.</p>

The earth may crumble. Or if God there be,<br />
He is the God of dying hearts and spent&mdash;<br />
A deity of chaos, for whose ends<br />
One thing alone is mete&mdash;ruin of life,<br />

Cast down your God! Cast down your peace and trust<br />
In His far Will! It is a solace mete<br />
For slaves, not men. With bitter hand, destroy<br />
This idol of destruction! Smite all haunts<br />
Of faith and resignation and defeat<br />
And rest and peace and comfort. Heaven and earth<br />
Alike are poisoned: somnolence in heaven,<br />
Decay on earth is regnant. Every faith<br />

Of God's bright hope. Then suddenly from Hell,<br />
Or from his own deep, labyrinthine heart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><br />
Sprang fiends to snatch him back from heaven's clear gate<br />
And God's deliverance. And his bitter lips,<br />
By thirst so nearly quenched made bitterer yet,<br />
Cried blasphemies against the powers of heaven<br />
And all bright starry hopes that light our days<br />
With faith and glory. And the hand of God,<br />
Inscrutably withheld, smote him not dumb,<br />
But suffered him to go. Now in our sight<br />
He rises to proclaim his searing doubt,<br />
His hot destroying passion, and tears down<br />
Our fairest altars. I, who was his friend,<br />
Hereby renounce him; and in sober words<br />
Counsel all men to flee the company<br />

Life's upward impulse. He is the darkness spread<br />
Ere yet was light&mdash;the matter ere was form&mdash;<br />
The vast inertia that on motion's heels<br />
Clings viper-like. Of life and form and growth<br />
He is negator; and his ceaseless joy<br />
Is to impede and drag to chaos back<br />
The shoot that toward the light triumphant springs.</p>

<p class="lines">But vain his victories, though he lingers yet<br />
With slowly narrowing frontiers. Past his will,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span><br />
Slowly the sons of light transcend, remould<br />
Their day and destiny; slowly there is born<br />
Order from chaos, flowers from formless mud,<br />
Light from the darkness, Faust's from Satan's soul.</p>

And passes and transcends me&mdash;and is mine!</p>

<p class="lines">I, one with thee, O child of Flame, behold<br />
Thy harvest&mdash;when the passion of the years<br />
Turns earthward, and in mastered order sets<br />
The house that is our dwelling. And therein,<br />
In the gold light of summer afternoons,<br />
With thee I too, careless and laughing, play<br />
Mid dreams and wonders that our will has made&mdash;<br />
Bathe in the beauty that our eyes have poured<br />
Upon the hills&mdash;and drink in thirsty draughts<br />
The happiness we have rained upon the earth.</p>

<p class="lines">I see, with ultimate unshaken vision!<br />
I see the earthly paradise; I see<br />
Men winged with wonder on the future throne<br />
Up infinite vistas where life's feet shall climb.<br />
Out of the dust, out of the plant and worm,<br />
Out of ourselves about whose feet still clings<br />
The reptile-slime of our creation&mdash;lo!<br />
Our children's children rise; and all my love<br />
Draws toward them and the light upon their brows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><br />

That shall survive me if indeed I die.<br />
Alone my life was lived; if now I go,<br />
It is alone into a quiet grave<br />
Above whose mound the fairer future days<br />
Shall pass, and I not know them. Yet my night<br />
Takes foregleam from the vision of that dawn<br />

In dawns of flaming.</p>
